  <h2 class="mt-5 orange-text" style="" >About me</h2>
  <p class="py-0 px-3 m-0" style="text-align: justify;">My journey in music education spans beyond mere theory, delving into the realms of piano playing and the profound enjoyment of music. Since 2012, I have witnessed the transformative power of music when students grasp the intricacies of piano playing and develop a deep appreciation for the art. My approach is holistic and deeply empathetic, recognizing that students thrive when they are truly understood and guided through their musical journey with clarity and enthusiasm.

    Having honed my skills as a music undergraduate at the prestigious Sir Zelman Cowen School of Music, Monash University, I bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to my teaching. I seamlessly combine technical proficiency with artistic expression, ensuring that students not only learn to play the piano but also develop a profound understanding and appreciation of music.
    
    Through my pedagogical training from my Masters study in Teaching, I have mastered powerful strategies rooted in the science of learning and improvement. My guidance goes beyond traditional methods, incorporating innovative approaches such as metaphors, interactive exercises, and practical demonstrations to foster a deep love for music and piano playing in each student.
    
    Join me on a musical journey that transcends technical instruction, and discover the joy of playing the piano with skill, passion, and a well-founded connection to the art of music.</p>
 
  <!--<p class="p-0 m-0">Each of these courses guides students through the AMEB Music Theory syllabus (Grades 3 & 4) over 14 sessions with classes held on <strong>Saturdays</strong>. During each session, students will explore foundational concepts via a <strong>45-minute interactive tutorial</strong> which includes guided <strong>hands-on workbook exercises</strong>. (Students are expected to <strong>complete leftover exercises</strong> in their own time as homework.) Then, in the remaining session time, students compare their previous week's homework with the AMEB provided answers and receive <strong>explanatory feedback</strong> for any discrepancies. Reading through the workbook lessons <strong>before attending</strong> each session is highly recommended as this means that session lectures are not the first exposures to new content. After the final tutorial, students complete the official AMEB Online Theory of Music Exam for <strong>certification</strong>.</p>-->

    <span class="red-text">Holistic approaches to education,</span> including music learning, are supported by academic research and statistical evidence, highlighting their effectiveness in producing better results. Books such as those by Diamond and Hopson (<i>Magic trees of the mind</i>, 1998) and Turnbull (<i>Coaching for Learning</i>, 2009) emphasise the importance of personalised coaching and creative exploration in enhancing learning outcomes. Research by Varner (<span style="word-wrap:break-word;"><i>doi.org/10.1177/1048371318798829</i></span>, 2019) and Kalliopuska and Ruokonen (<i><span style="word-wrap:break-word;">doi.org/10.2466/pms.1993.76.1.131</span></i>, 1993) also underscores the benefits of holistic music education in fostering cognitive, emotional, and social development in students.

    <span class="red-text">This literature reveals</span> that holistic programs lead to deeper understanding, improved retention of information, and increased motivation among learners. The integration of diverse learning methods, such as interactive tutorials, social interactions, and experiential learning, contributes to a more comprehensive and enriching educational experience. By leveraging a holistic approach, students not only excel academically but also develop essential life skills and a lifelong passion for music.
