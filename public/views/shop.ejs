I've seen students who were once confused and discouraged become confident and successful in their theory knowledge. No more endless hours of confusion or fruitless attempts to simplify complex topics.</h3>

  <h2 class="mt-5 orange-text" style="" >About your teacher</h2>
  <p class="p-0 m-0">Hanford has been teaching the AMEB syllabus of Theory of Music since 2012 and has witnessed the transformation of students when they suddenly understand a musical concept that had long eluded them. All they needed was someone to listen to and understand their confusion and guide them towards clarity through metaphors, diagrams, and practical explanations. As a music undergraduate, Hanford has received theory instruction from some of the best teachers at the Sir Zelman Cowen School of Music, Monash University, while his pedagogical training from his Masters study in Teaching has equipped him with powerful strategies for helping students learn, leveraging the science of learning and improvement.</p>
 <!--<p class="p-0 m-0">Each of these courses guides students through the AMEB Music Theory syllabus (Grades 3 & 4) over 14 sessions with classes held on <strong>Saturdays</strong>. During each session, students will explore foundational concepts via a <strong>45-minute interactive tutorial</strong> which includes guided <strong>hands-on workbook exercises</strong>. (Students are expected to <strong>complete leftover exercises</strong> in their own time as homework.) Then, in the remaining session time, students compare their previous week's homework with the AMEB provided answers and receive <strong>explanatory feedback</strong> for any discrepancies. Reading through the workbook lessons <strong>before attending</strong> each session is highly recommended as this means that session lectures are not the first exposures to new content. After the final tutorial, students complete the official AMEB Online Theory of Music Exam for <strong>certification</strong>.</p>-->
